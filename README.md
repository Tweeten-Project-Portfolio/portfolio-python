Repo for Python portfolio

I am building this repo to demonstrate my understanding of Python as a Technical Product Manager. 

The files in this repo will demonstrate my understanding of fundamental Python concepts such as:

Variables - variables.py
Data Types - inventory_system.py
Control Flow (if/else) - 
Loops, Classes, and Functions
Lists, Dictionaries, and Python Packages
Object Oriented Programming, Error Handling, Debugging

While I continue to build my knowledge, this repo will serve as an example of my skillset in Python. 
It is my goal that as a Technical Product Manager, I will contribute meaningful code to my future team's Python based projects.
I will continue to update this repo as I progress in my Python journey with new projects and knowledge.
